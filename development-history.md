**To:** Project Reviewer
**From:** Gemini, AI Assistant
**Date:** September 4, 2025
**Subject:** Detailed Summary of the MVP Build Process for the NeuroScope AI News Pipeline

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development process for the NeuroScope AI News Pipeline, as orchestrated by an architect agent and executed by a series of coding agents. The goal of this document is to offer a clear and detailed narrative of the project's progression, decisions, and outcomes to facilitate a thorough review of the architect's work and the final state of the MVP codebase.

The core mission of the NeuroScope MVP was to create a low-cost, maintainable, and reliable terminal-first pipeline. This pipeline is designed to ingest neuroscience and AI-related news from RSS feeds and approved web pages, process this information by clustering near-duplicates, and generate ranked, watchdog-style summaries with clear citations. The entire process was guided by the `architect.md` file, which served as the authoritative source of truth for all architectural decisions, technical specifications, and operating principles.

## 2. The Architect's Vision: `architect.md`

The development process was anchored by a detailed architectural document, `architect.md`. This document laid out the foundational principles and technical specifications for the MVP. Key highlights include:

*   **Identity and Mission:** The project, named NeuroScope, aims to deliver a terminal-only pipeline for ingesting, clustering, summarizing, and ranking neuro/AI news with an evidence-first, watchdog-style tone.
*   **Technical Stack:** The MVP is built on a lean and modern stack, including Python 3.11+, the Typer framework for the CLI, and SQLite for local database operations, with an eye towards future integration with Neon Postgres and pgvector. For AI functionalities, the project leverages OpenAI for embeddings and is designed to be model-agnostic for summarization via OpenRouter.
*   **Core Architectural Patterns:** The system is designed as a series of idempotent CLI subcommands (`fetch`, `extract`, `cluster`, `summarize`, `publish`, `all`), ensuring that re-running stages does not lead to duplicated work. This design emphasizes reliability and simplicity.
*   **Key Features:** Central to the architecture are near-duplicate detection using MinHash/LSH, cluster-centric summarization to avoid redundant reporting, and a clear, citation-first approach to all generated content.

## 3. The Development Narrative: A Chronological Review of Work Orders

The construction of the MVP was executed through a sequence of twelve work orders, each issued by the architect to a coding agent. This section details the objective and outcome of each work order, providing a clear trail of the development process.

### Work Order 001: Implementing MinHash/LSH Clustering
*   **Objective:** To replace the initial SimHash clustering mechanism with the more robust MinHash/LSH technique using the `datasketch` library, as specified in `architect.md`.
*   **Outcome:** The coding agent successfully refactored the clustering logic, introduced configurable Jaccard similarity thresholds, and updated the corresponding tests, bringing the implementation in line with the architectural blueprint.

### Work Order 002: Persisting Summaries with Versioned Caching
*   **Objective:** To introduce a `summaries` table to the database for persisting generated summaries, implementing a versioned caching mechanism to avoid re-computation.
*   **Outcome:** A `summaries` table was added to the SQLite schema. The summarization step was updated to be idempotent, using a version hash composed of the prompt version, guardrails, and article IDs. The `publish` command was decoupled to read from this new table.

### Work Order 003: Wiring the CLI to DB-Backed Summaries
*   **Objective:** To connect the `publish` CLI command to the newly created DB-backed summary persistence layer, ensuring it no longer triggers re-computation.
*   **Outcome:** The `publish` command was successfully rewired to read directly from the `summaries` table. This change enhances efficiency and ensures consistency in the published output.

### Work Order 004: Enforcing `robots.txt` and Cached HTTP
*   **Objective:** To ensure the pipeline respects web standards by implementing `robots.txt` checks and to improve efficiency by using cached HTTP requests for fetching article content.
*   **Outcome:** A new module for handling `robots.txt` was introduced, and the extraction process was updated to fall back to feed-based text when fetching is disallowed. Per-domain concurrency was also limited to ensure polite crawling behavior.

### Work Order 005: Model-Agnostic LLM Summarization via OpenRouter
*   **Objective:** To implement a flexible, model-agnostic framework for LLM-powered summarization using OpenRouter, with Kimi-K2 as the default model.
*   **Outcome:** The coding agent introduced a new `llm.py` module to handle interactions with OpenRouter. The summarization logic was updated to use this provider, and the versioned caching key was expanded to include the model name, allowing for deterministic and comparable outputs from different models.

### Work Order 006: Building a Model Evaluation Harness
*   **Objective:** To create a dedicated CLI command for evaluating and comparing summaries from multiple LLMs without altering the persisted production summaries.
*   **Outcome:** A new `eval-models` command was added to the CLI. This command generates side-by-side comparison reports in Markdown, enabling the architect and future users to assess the quality of different models for the summarization task.

### Work Order 007: Polishing the Ranking Algorithm
*   **Objective:** To refine the content ranking algorithm by implementing an exponential freshness decay, adding heuristic-based boosts and penalties, and finalizing the source weighting.
*   **Outcome:** The ranking logic in `rank.py` was updated to incorporate a configurable half-life for freshness, along with boosts for factors like pre-registration and open code, and penalties for missing methodology details.

### Work Order 008: Adding CI with Pytest and Coverage Gates
*   **Objective:** To establish a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and enforce code quality standards.
*   **Outcome:** A CI workflow was created to run `pytest` with coverage analysis on every push and pull request. A coverage threshold of 85% was enforced, ensuring that new code is adequately tested.

### Work Order 009: Integrating Observability with Langfuse
*   **Objective:** To add optional observability hooks using Langfuse to trace the execution of the pipeline stages and LLM calls.
*   **Outcome:** A no-op wrapper for Langfuse was implemented, allowing for detailed tracing when configured via environment variables without affecting performance or creating dependencies when disabled. The `run_report.json` was also enriched with timing and count metrics for each stage.

### Work Order 010 & 011: Finalizing Documentation and Environment Configuration
*   **Objective:** To polish all user-facing documentation, including the `README.md` and `.env.example` files, ensuring they accurately reflect the final state of the MVP's CLI and configuration options.
*   **Outcome:** An initial attempt at this task revealed a drift between the documentation and the actual implementation. A corrective work order was issued, resulting in a fully aligned `README.md` and `.env.example` that accurately describe the terminal-first CLI, the use of OpenRouter, and all relevant environment variables.

### Work Order 012: Restoring the Test Suite and Finalizing Docs
*   **Objective:** To finalize the MVP by restoring the complete test suite that had been inadvertently omitted in a previous commit and making a final correction to the persistence documentation.
*   **Outcome:** The full test suite was successfully restored, ensuring that the CI pipeline could run green with the required test coverage. A minor correction was made to the `README.md` to clarify that SQLite is the default database, with Postgres as a future option.

## 4. Final MVP Status

Upon the completion of the twelfth work order, the NeuroScope AI News Pipeline MVP is considered feature-complete as per the specifications laid out in `architect.md`. The final product is a fully functional, terminal-first application that successfully ingests, processes, and presents AI and neuroscience news in a structured and insightful manner.

The project adheres to the core principles of being low-cost, maintainable, and reliable. The codebase is well-tested, with automated CI/CD checks ensuring quality. The documentation is now fully aligned with the implementation, providing clear instructions for setup and usage.

## 5. Conclusion for the Reviewer

The development of the NeuroScope MVP demonstrates a robust and well-structured process guided by a clear architectural vision. The architect agent effectively translated the high-level requirements from `architect.md` into a series of discrete, actionable work orders. The iterative nature of the development, with each work order building upon the last, resulted in a high-quality, feature-complete MVP that meets all of its initial goals.

This document, by detailing each step of the journey, should provide you with the necessary context to effectively review the architect's work and the final codebase. The process showcases a strong adherence to software engineering best practices, including clear documentation, automated testing, and a modular, extensible architecture.
