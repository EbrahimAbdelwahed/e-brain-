Below is a curated list of active X accounts that regularly post about interesting brain facts. These accounts cover a range of topics, including common knowledge (e.g., basic brain functions and myths), niche arguments (e.g., debates on consciousness or neuroplasticity), recent findings (e.g., new studies on neural networks or memory), core neuroscientific theories and concepts (e.g., synaptic plasticity, predictive coding), and computational neuroscience (e.g., modeling brain activity or AI-brain parallels). I focused on accounts that are verified as active based on recent posting history (within the last few months as of August 2025), with exact handles provided. The list is organized alphabetically for ease, with a brief description of each account's focus and typical content.
