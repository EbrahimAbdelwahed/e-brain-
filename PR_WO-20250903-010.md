Title: [WO WO-20250903-010] MVP finalization: env template, docs, runbook polish (Draft)

Problem
- The environment template was missing the latest variables (OpenRouter, summarization controls, observability, ranking), and README did not fully reflect the current runbook and optional features. No changelog entry summarized MVP scope.

Approach
- Expanded `.env.example` with commented, names-only placeholders for all current env vars.
- Updated README Environment section to mirror `.env.example` and added Runbook details (including evaluation note, summarization flags, observability, ranking half-life).
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` with a concise MVP entry covering major features.

Tradeoffs
- README includes optional/feature-flag sections (eval-models, OpenRouter, observability) that are no-ops unless corresponding env and modules are enabled.
- No functional changes were made per scope; future code may further align CLI surface area with documented flags.

Evidence
- See diff in this PR for changes to `.env.example`, `README.md`, and new `CHANGELOG.md`.
