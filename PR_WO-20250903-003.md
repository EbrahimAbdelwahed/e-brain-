Title: [WO WO-20250903-003] Wire CLI publish to DB-backed summaries; remove recomputation

Problem
- CLI `publish` recomputed summaries by calling `summarize()`, duplicating work and risking inconsistency with persisted summaries.
- Needed: `publish` should read summaries persisted in DB and write outputs with unchanged shapes, with graceful no-op when no summaries exist.

Approach
- Added DB-backed publish implementation in `pipeline/main.py` (reads `summaries` table, rehydrates bullets/citations, joins rank scores, writes `summaries.md` and `clusters.json`, marks `published_at`).
- Rewired Typer CLI `publish` subcommand in `pipeline/__main__.py` to call `pipeline.main.publish` (no summarize). Logs include no-op message if empty.
- Updated `all` flow to run `summarize` once, then `publish` from DB (no re-summarize inside publish). Added `summarize_sec` to `run_report.json`.
- Kept output shapes unchanged; fixed minor Unicode artifacts in headers.

Tradeoffs
- Directly calling CLI functions in tests requires passing `since=None` and `dry_run=False` due to Typer Option defaults; kept tests simple and offline.
- `run_report.json` in `publish` command remains minimal (counts + `publish_sec`); deeper metrics are tracked in `all` runs.

Tests & Evidence
- Unit: `tests/test_cli_publish.py::test_cli_publish_does_not_call_summarize_when_summaries_exist` — monkeypatches `pipeline.summarize.summarize` to raise; CLI `publish` still succeeds and writes files.
- Unit: `tests/test_cli_publish.py::test_cli_publish_empty_db_noop` — fresh DB, CLI `publish` logs "No summaries in DB to publish." and writes no files.
- Integration: `tests/test_cli_publish.py::test_cli_publish_integration_with_fixtures` — end-to-end on fixtures with `EMBED_OFFLINE=1`; verifies outputs exist and contain "Bottom line:".
- Local run: `pytest -q` — all tests pass.
- Coverage: within repo norms; gates best-effort met (global ~= 85%+, core ~= 95%+).

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: accidental summarize call via import path — Mitigated by unit test that forces summarize to raise.
- Risk: empty DB edge case — Mitigated with explicit log and early return.
- Risk: output shape drift — Reused persisted shapes, retained bullets/citations structure, and validated in tests.

Checklists
- Lint: passed (repo norms).
- Types: N/A minimal typing changes.
- Tests: added + passing locally.
- Coverage: at/near gates per local run.
- SEC scan: N/A (no network keys, no secrets committed).
